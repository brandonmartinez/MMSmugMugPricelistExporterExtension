# MMSmugMugPricelistExporterPlugin

A Google Chrome extension to export your SmugMug pricelists to a tabular, and more importantly, copyable format. Modifies the pricelist UI to expand all products and SKUs, and then adds an export button to the header.

## How To Install

2. Click the Install button in the prompt

## Folder
1. In Chrome, open `chrome://extensions/`
2. Check `Developer mode` if it's not
3. Click `Load unpacked extensionâ€¦`
4. Navigate to the `app` folder and click OK
